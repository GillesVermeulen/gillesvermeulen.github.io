They came to use with a question: how do we turn our popular show \"De Regel van 3S\" into an interactive episode?</p><p>As an answer to that question, we developed a framework that allows them to absorb the viewer into the fiction. The viewer not only gets to decide the faith of the characters, but is also tested for their speed and agility if they want to bring the interactive segments to a good end. Try it for yourself <a href=\"https://www.ketnet.be/spelen/regel-het-voor-dries-de-kunstroof\">in your browser</a> or search for \"Regel het voor Dries: de kunstroof\" in the Ketnet app!</p><p>Because this was uncharted terrain for the show's producers, I guided them with the writing of the script and during the recording of some action sequences.</p>",
